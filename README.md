## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

We learned how to build UI with React and update the state.

### Continued development

We want to focus more on State management and debugging.

### Useful resources

- [State Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) - This helped with the syntax and how to apply it to a function.

## Where to find everything

The components are in the components folder in the src folder.
The assets are already optimized.

## Building your project

1. Initialize your project
```
npx create-react-app appName
cd appName
npm start
```
2. Edit the files you want to and it updates on the localhost.

## Deploying your project

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
